# IAM

**Protocol:** Query (XML) — `POST http://localhost:4566/` with `Action=` parameter

## AWS Sign-In login credentials

Floci also implements the AWS Sign-In data-plane flow used by the AWS CLI login credentials
provider. The local `GET /v1/authorize` endpoint performs the emulator's local sign-in and returns
a one-time PKCE authorization code. `POST /v1/token` exchanges that code (or a refresh token) for
15-minute temporary SigV4 credentials registered with the local IAM account.

```bash
aws login --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 --region us-east-1
aws sts get-caller-identity --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
```

The authorize endpoint first presents a local consent page, then redirects back to the callback
listener owned by the AWS CLI. Floci does not contact AWS or require a real AWS account. This
follows the AWS Sign-In `AuthorizeOAuth2Access` and `CreateOAuth2Token` wire shapes, including
one-time codes, PKCE verification, refresh-token expiry, and the `aws_sigv4` temporary credential
type.

| GetUserPolicy | Returns an inline policy stored on a user. |
| DeleteUserPolicy | Deletes an inline policy from a user. |
| ListUserPolicies | Lists inline policy names stored on a user. |

### Instance Profiles

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateInstanceProfile | Creates an IAM instance profile, applying any `Tags` given at creation. |
| GetInstanceProfile | Returns an instance profile and its roles. |
| DeleteInstanceProfile | Deletes an instance profile from the local IAM store. |
| ListInstanceProfiles | Lists IAM instance profiles. |
| AddRoleToInstanceProfile | Adds a role to an instance profile. |
| RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile | Removes a role from an instance profile. |
| ListInstanceProfilesForRole | Lists instance profiles associated with a role. |
| TagInstanceProfile | Adds tags to an instance profile. |
| UntagInstanceProfile | Removes tags from an instance profile. |
| ListInstanceProfileTags | Lists tags stored for an instance profile. |

`CreateInstanceProfile`, `GetInstanceProfile` and `ListInstanceProfilesForRole` include an instance
profile's own tags inline. `ListInstanceProfiles` omits them: like `ListRoles`, its own operation
documentation says "this operation does not return tags, even though they are an attribute of the
returned object", even though the `InstanceProfile` shape itself carries no such exclusion note.
Tags on a role embedded in `InstanceProfileList` are always omitted, matching `GetInstanceProfile`'s
own documented role subset.

### Access Keys

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateAccessKey | Creates access-key credentials for a user. |
| GetAccessKeyLastUsed | Returns the stored last-used metadata for an access key. |
| ListAccessKeys | Lists access keys for a user. |
| UpdateAccessKey | Updates an access key's status. |
| DeleteAccessKey | Deletes an access key from a user. |

### Account Aliases

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ListAccountAliases | Lists the alias set for the account, or an empty list when none is set. |
| CreateAccountAlias | Sets the account alias. An account can hold only one. |
| DeleteAccountAlias | Removes the account alias. |

An account holds one alias, and AWS enforces that by replacement rather than rejection:
`CreateAccountAlias` with a new value silently swaps the current one. `EntityAlreadyExists` means
the requested name is taken — on AWS that includes names held by other accounts, since aliases are
globally unique, but the store here is per-account so only "you already hold this one" arises.

`DeleteAccountAlias` must name the current alias; a mismatch returns `NoSuchEntity`. Both verbs
apply the same pattern constraint, so a malformed value returns `ValidationError` on either.
Aliases are 3–63 characters of lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, may not start or end with a
hyphen, and may not contain two hyphens in a row — AWS's documented
`^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9]|-(?!-)){1,61}[a-z0-9]$`. The `ValidationError` message is reproduced from AWS
verbatim and does not itself mention the consecutive-hyphen rule.

Set `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ACCOUNT_ALIAS` to seed an alias at startup, for callers that expect to
read one without creating it first. It seeds the **default account** only, so a caller signing
with a credential that resolves to a different account still reads an empty list. Seeding is
skipped when an alias is already stored, so under `storage.mode: persistent` a changed value has
no effect on later starts — the skip is logged at debug with both values. `/_floci/state/reset`
clears the alias without re-seeding it, as it does the optional deployer principal; the seed
returns on restart.

### Account Password Policy

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| GetAccountPasswordPolicy | Returns the account's password policy. |
| UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy | Replaces the account's password policy wholesale. |
| DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy | Removes the account's password policy. |

An account holds one password policy. `UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy` replaces it wholesale rather
than merging — a field the caller omits resets to its AWS-documented default (`false` for the
boolean requirements, `AllowUsersToChangePassword` and `HardExpiry`; `6` for
`MinimumPasswordLength`; unset for the optional `MaxPasswordAge` and `PasswordReusePrevention`)
rather than carrying over the previous value. Unlike the two optional integer fields,
`HardExpiry` is never absent from the response — AWS documents it as a boolean that always
defaults to `false`, so `GetAccountPasswordPolicy` always echoes it back. `ExpirePasswords` is
derived, not stored: it reports `true` exactly when `MaxPasswordAge` is set.

`GetAccountPasswordPolicy` and `DeleteAccountPasswordPolicy` both return `NoSuchEntity` when no
policy has ever been set — a documented, expected result the Terraform provider's
`aws_iam_account_password_policy` resource branches on. `MinimumPasswordLength` must be 6–128,
`MaxPasswordAge` 1–1095, and `PasswordReusePrevention` 1–24; a value outside those ranges is
rejected with `ValidationError`. The integer parameters (`MinimumPasswordLength`, `MaxPasswordAge`,
`PasswordReusePrevention`) and the boolean parameters both reject anything that isn't parseable —
a malformed integer or a value other than `true`/`false` (case-insensitive) returns
`ValidationError` rather than silently falling back to a default.

### OIDC Identity Providers

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateOpenIDConnectProvider | Creates an OIDC identity provider from an https URL. |
| GetOpenIDConnectProvider | Returns a provider's URL, client IDs, thumbprints and tags. |
| ListOpenIDConnectProviders | Lists the ARNs of stored OIDC providers. |
| DeleteOpenIDConnectProvider | Deletes an OIDC identity provider. |
| AddClientIDToOpenIDConnectProvider | Adds a client ID (audience) to a provider. |
| RemoveClientIDFromOpenIDConnectProvider | Removes a client ID from a provider. |
| UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint | Replaces a provider's thumbprint list. |
| TagOpenIDConnectProvider | Adds tags to a provider. |
| UntagOpenIDConnectProvider | Removes tags from a provider. |
| ListOpenIDConnectProviderTags | Lists tags stored for a provider. |

A provider is identified by its URL, so the ARN is derived from it rather than from a generated
id: `https://oidc.eks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE` becomes
`arn:aws:iam::<account>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE`. Creating
the same URL twice returns `EntityAlreadyExists`. As on AWS, `GetOpenIDConnectProvider` reports
the URL **without** its scheme.

The URL must begin with `https://` and is at most 255 characters. It is not normalized, matching
AWS: a trailing slash or a difference in case produces a separate provider rather than a
duplicate.

A provider holds at most 100 client IDs (`LimitExceeded` beyond that) and 5 thumbprints
(`InvalidInput` beyond that). Adding a client ID that is already present, and removing one that
was never added, both succeed and change nothing, as they do on AWS.

Thumbprints are stored and echoed back but never validated against the remote endpoint, since
nothing here performs the TLS handshake they describe.

### SAML Identity Providers

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateSAMLProvider | Creates a SAML identity provider from a metadata document, with optional tags echoed back in the response. |
| GetSAMLProvider | Returns a provider's creation date, tags, and a metadata document rebuilt from its stored entity ID and signing certificate. |
| ListSAMLProviders | Lists the stored SAML providers of the calling account. |
| UpdateSAMLProvider | Replaces a provider's metadata document. |
| DeleteSAMLProvider | Deletes a SAML identity provider. |
| TagSAMLProvider | Adds tags to a SAML identity provider. |
| UntagSAMLProvider | Removes tags from a SAML identity provider. |
| ListSAMLProviderTags | Lists tags stored for a SAML identity provider. |

A provider is identified by name, giving an ARN of the form `arn:aws:iam::<account>:saml-provider/<name>`.
The name must match `[A-Za-z0-9+=,.@_-]{1,128}`, and creating the same name twice returns
`EntityAlreadyExists`. An empty or unparseable metadata document returns `InvalidInput`. `Tags` on the
create request are validated before anything is stored, so a request carrying more than 50 of them
fails without leaving a provider behind, as AWS documents.

Floci stores only the entity ID and signing certificate parsed from the metadata, so `GetSAMLProvider`
returns a minimal rebuilt document rather than the one that was uploaded. `UpdateSAMLProvider` re-parses
a new `SAMLMetadataDocument` the same way and replaces the stored entity ID and certificate; omitting it
leaves the provider unchanged, since it is optional on the request. AWS's current `UpdateSAMLProvider`
and `GetSAMLProvider` also manage an `AssertionEncryptionMode` and a private-key list for decrypting
encrypted assertions; Floci's assertion verifier only checks signatures against a single certificate and
does not model encrypted assertions at all, so neither of those is modeled here either.
`DeleteSAMLProvider` does not check or update any role whose trust policy still references the provider's
ARN, matching AWS's own documented behavior: the delete succeeds regardless, and it is a later
`AssumeRoleWithSAML` against the now-dangling ARN that fails, not this call. `CreateSAMLProvider` and
`GetSAMLProvider` return their tags sorted by key, which is what AWS documents for those two responses;
`ListSAMLProviderTags` is sorted the same way here for consistency, though AWS does not document an
order for it. Providers created here are used by `AssumeRoleWithSAML` for trust-policy and assertion
validation.

### Login Profiles

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateLoginProfile | Creates a console password login profile for a user. |
| GetLoginProfile | Returns a user's login profile. |
| UpdateLoginProfile | Updates a user's login profile password and/or reset-required flag. |
| DeleteLoginProfile | Deletes a user's login profile. |

`UserName` is optional on `CreateLoginProfile`, `GetLoginProfile` and `DeleteLoginProfile`: it
defaults to the user resolved from the signing access key, the same fallback `GetUser` uses. It is
required on `UpdateLoginProfile`, matching the AWS API.

A user holds at most one login profile: `CreateLoginProfile` on a user that already has one
returns `EntityAlreadyExists`; `Get`/`Update`/`DeleteLoginProfile` on a user with none return
`NoSuchEntity`. `Password` is required on `CreateLoginProfile` and optional on
`UpdateLoginProfile`; an omitted field on `UpdateLoginProfile` (`Password` or
`PasswordResetRequired`) leaves that field unchanged, unlike `UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy`'s
wholesale replace. A password must be 1–128 characters from AWS's documented password character
class, and when the account has an [account password policy](#account-password-policy) set, it is
also checked against that policy's length and character-class requirements, with
`PasswordPolicyViolation` returned on either action if it doesn't comply. The password itself is never
echoed back by any of these actions, matching AWS.

`DeleteUser` returns `DeleteConflict`, as on AWS, while the user still has a login profile, access
keys, inline policies, attached managed policies, group memberships, an
[enabled MFA device](#multi-factor-authentication), a
[signing certificate](#signing-certificates), an [SSH public key](#ssh-public-keys) or a
[service-specific credential](#service-specific-credentials): remove those first. That is every
item on AWS's own list of what to delete before deleting a user programmatically. Renaming a user
with `UpdateUser` carries all of them to the new name, along with its login profile, access keys and
group membership. Unlike AWS, Floci does not rewrite policy documents that name the user's ARN, so a
resource or trust policy that referred to the old name still refers to it after a rename.

### Policy Simulation

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SimulatePrincipalPolicy | Evaluates requested actions and resources against the resolved principal's policies. |
| SimulateCustomPolicy | Evaluates requested actions and resources against a standalone set of policy documents, with an optional permissions boundary. |
| GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy | Lists the context keys referenced across a set of policy documents. |
| GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy | Lists the context keys referenced across a resolved principal's policies, plus any additional documents supplied. |

`GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy` and `GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy` return every Condition
operator's key, and every `${...}` policy variable found in a Resource pattern or a Condition
value, in the order statements are found. A variable's default value (`${key, 'default'}`) is
stripped, and the three single-character escapes (`${*}`, `${?}`, `${$}`) are excluded, since
they substitute a literal character rather than naming a context key. The list is neither sorted
nor de-duplicated, matching AWS's own documented
example response, which repeats a key referenced by more than one statement.

`PolicySourceArn` on `SimulatePrincipalPolicy` and `GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy` resolves an IAM
user or role only, not a group. `SimulateCustomPolicy` accepts only one
`PermissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList` document, matching AWS's own documented limit; extra documents
beyond the first are ignored. Neither simulation action evaluates a resource-based policy
(`ResourcePolicy`) or `OrderedOrganizationPolicyInputList`, and neither returns
`MatchedStatements`, `ResourceSpecificResults`, or a `PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail`: only the
top-level `EvalDecision` is populated. `ContextEntries.member.N.ContextKeyType` is accepted but not
read; the comparison is driven entirely by the policy's own condition operator (`Bool`,
`NumericEquals`, `DateEquals`, and so on), not by the declared type.

### Last-Accessed Reporting

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails | Starts an Access Advisor job for a user, group, role or managed policy and returns its job ID. |
| GetServiceLastAccessedDetails | Returns the job's status and its service-access report. |
| GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities | Returns the job's status and the entities that used a given service. |
| ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess | Lists the policies that let an IAM identity access each requested service. |

Floci does not record service access. Nothing populates a principal's usage history, and
`GetAccessKeyLastUsed` already answers with AWS's documented "never used" shape rather than
inventing one. That shape is what these actions reproduce: AWS lists every service an entity could
reach through its permissions policies, and for a service with no access attempt it leaves
`LastAuthenticated` and `TotalAuthenticatedEntities` null rather than dropping the service. So
`GetServiceLastAccessedDetails` returns a real, policy-derived `ServicesLastAccessed` list in which
every entry is that "no attempt" shape. The missing piece is the usage timestamps, not the list.

A grant that names no namespace is expanded against the vendored catalog of IAM service namespaces
in `src/main/resources/aws/iam-service-namespaces.json`: an `Action` of `*` reaches every published
service, a globbed prefix such as `s3*` reaches the ones it matches, and an `Allow` with `NotAction`
reaches everything the list does not carve out entirely. A namespace a policy names outright is
reported whether or not the catalog knows it, so a catalog that has fallen behind an AWS launch
still reports an explicitly named service; only wildcard expansion depends on it being current.

That catalog is generated by `tools/aws/regen_service_namespaces.py` from AWS's Service Reference
Information index, whose per-service `service` field is the IAM namespace itself. botocore is
deliberately not the source: a namespace is not any botocore field, since CloudWatch's
`endpointPrefix` is `monitoring` and its `serviceId` is `CloudWatch` against an IAM namespace of
`cloudwatch`. Because that index is a live endpoint rather than a pinned dependency, the gate is not
byte-equality: `make iam-namespaces-check` validates the file's shape offline, and
`make iam-namespaces-verify` checks online that every namespace in it still exists upstream, so
nothing invented can survive. Services AWS has added since the last `make iam-namespaces-sync` are
reported by that check without failing it, since being behind makes the list incomplete rather than
wrong.

`ServiceName` is a required member that AWS fills with a display name (`Amazon S3`); Floci has no
such mapping and repeats the namespace instead.

`GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities` is policy-derived in the same way. AWS reports the
entities that *could have used* the reported permissions to reach a service, so a group report
lists the group's users, a policy report lists the users and roles the policy is attached to plus
the users of any group it is attached to, and a user or role report lists that entity. A user
reachable by more than one of those paths is listed once. Entities are omitted when the reported permissions do not
grant the requested service at all. `LastAuthenticated` is absent on every entry, since that is
the part Floci does not record.

`GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` resolves the ARN first and returns `NoSuchEntity` for one that
names nothing, rather than handing out a job ID that could never be meaningful. That resolution
checks the whole ARN: an ARN whose account is not the caller's, or whose path is not the resolved
entity's own, names no entity and is rejected rather than falling back to a same-named local one. A
job belongs to the account that created it, an unknown `JobId` is `NoSuchEntity`, and `Granularity`
is validated against `SERVICE_LEVEL`/`ACTION_LEVEL` and echoed back as `JobType`.

The report is produced when the job is created and stored with it, matching AWS, where
`GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` produces a report and the `Get*` operations retrieve that one.
So a completed job keeps answering what it answered first: editing the policies afterwards does not
change it, and deleting the entity it covers does not stop a valid `JobId` from resolving. There is
nothing left to compute asynchronously, so a job is complete when created and its creation and
completion timestamps are the same instant. Jobs are kept for the life of the store: AWS documents
no expiry for a `JobId`, so ageing them out would mean inventing a retention window and failing a
caller holding an ID that AWS would still answer.

Both readers honour `MaxItems` and `Marker` and report `IsTruncated` truthfully, returning a
`Marker` only when a page remains. This differs from the rest of this page, where pagination inputs
are accepted and ignored; these actions apply them rather than inherit that gap.

`ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess` is not an Access Advisor job and needs no usage history: AWS
defines it purely over permissions-policy logic, so it is answered from real policy content. It
follows AWS's documented scoping, where a user contributes its own managed and inline policies
plus those of every group it belongs to, while a group or role contributes only its own. Managed
policies are reported with their ARN and their current default version is the one read; inline
policies have no ARN and are identified by the entity holding them. Only `Allow` grants, so a
Deny-only policy is not listed, and an `Allow` with `NotAction` grants every service the list does
not carve out. Permissions boundaries are excluded, as the operation's documentation requires, and
resource-based policies, ACLs, Organizations policies and trust policies are not consulted.
Resources and conditions are not evaluated either: the question is which policies could grant the
service at all, not whether one specific call would be authorized.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateVirtualMFADevice | Creates an unassigned virtual MFA device and returns its `SerialNumber` and `Base32StringSeed`. |
| ListVirtualMFADevices | Lists the account's virtual MFA devices, filtered by `AssignmentStatus` (`Assigned`, `Unassigned` or `Any`, defaulting to `Any`). |
| DeleteVirtualMFADevice | Deletes a device. Returns `DeleteConflict` while it is still assigned to a user. |
| EnableMFADevice | Assigns a device to a user, after verifying two consecutive authentication codes. |
| DeactivateMFADevice | Detaches a device from its user, leaving the device itself in place. |
| ResyncMFADevice | Re-synchronizes an assigned device, again against two consecutive codes. |
| ListMFADevices | Lists the devices assigned to a user. |
| TagMFADevice / UntagMFADevice / ListMFADeviceTags | Manage a device's tags. |

The seed is real. `CreateVirtualMFADevice` generates a 160-bit secret from `SecureRandom` and
returns it as an RFC 4648 base32 string (base64-wrapped on the wire, as AWS models the member), so
an authenticator app seeded from it produces codes Floci accepts. `EnableMFADevice` and
`ResyncMFADevice` verify those codes as RFC 6238 TOTP (HMAC-SHA1 over 30-second steps, truncated
to six digits) and return `InvalidAuthenticationCode` when they don't match, so a caller that does
not hold the seed cannot enable a device. The two codes must be consecutive, as AWS asks ("a
subsequent authentication code"), so the same code sent twice is rejected. `EnableMFADevice`
allows one 30-second step of drift either side; `ResyncMFADevice` allows ten, since a device
needing resync is by definition one whose clock has wandered.

`SerialNumber` is the device ARN, `arn:aws:iam::<account>:mfa/<name>`, so `Path` and
`VirtualMFADeviceName` together identify a device. A device survives `DeactivateMFADevice` with its
seed intact, so re-enabling it needs no re-provisioning. `DeleteUser` returns `DeleteConflict` while
the user still holds a device, and a user with one reports `mfa_active` as `TRUE` in the credential
report. Renaming a user with `UpdateUser` carries the assignment to the new name, alongside the
login profile and access keys it already moved.

A user may hold up to 8 devices, the per-user limit the IAM User Guide documents, after which
`EnableMFADevice` returns `LimitExceeded`. That is the only MFA quota Floci enforces:
`CreateVirtualMFADevice` models `LimitExceeded` too, but AWS publishes no account-wide figure for
virtual MFA devices, so there is nothing to enforce it against.

Request shapes are checked before the device is resolved, so a `SerialNumber` outside its modeled
9-to-256 range is a `ValidationError` rather than a `NoSuchEntity` for a device that could not have
existed. Note that `VirtualMFADeviceName` is the one IAM name type with no documented maximum
length: a name longer than the 128 characters other IAM names stop at is accepted here, as on AWS.
`ListMFADeviceTags` honors `Marker` and `MaxItems`, sorting by tag key first as AWS documents, so a
client can walk the result a page at a time. IAM's other tag readers in Floci still return every
tag with `IsTruncated=false`.

`VirtualMFADeviceName` has no maximum length, but the serial number it mints does: 256 characters.
A name long enough to overflow that is rejected at creation rather than producing a device whose
serial every other MFA operation would refuse.

`QRCodePNG` is not returned. AWS marks it optional, and rendering a PNG would mean taking on a QR
encoder dependency for a field whose content is derivable: it encodes
`otpauth://totp/<device>@<account>?secret=<Base32String>`, which a caller can build from the
`Base32StringSeed` that *is* returned. `aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device` works against Floci with
`--bootstrap-method Base32StringSeed`, and fails only when asked for the QR code specifically.

`GetMFADevice` is not implemented: AWS states "for this API, we only accept FIDO security key
ARNs", and Floci models virtual devices only. Hardware TOTP tokens and FIDO security keys are not
modeled either, so `ListMFADevices` returns only virtual devices where AWS would return every type.

#### What a device does not yet affect

Enabling a device records state and nothing more. It does not change what a request is allowed to
do:

- **Policy evaluation ignores MFA.** `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` and `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` are
  never placed in the request context, so under [enforcement](#iam-enforcement-mode) a statement
  conditioned on either key does not behave as it would on AWS. Both directions fail closed rather
  than open: an `Allow` gated on `Bool: {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"}` never grants,
  because a missing key fails the condition block; and the common
  `Deny` + `BoolIfExists: {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"}` lockout idiom always denies,
  because `IfExists` passes on a missing key. So an MFA-gated policy is stricter than AWS here, not
  laxer, but a device being enabled will not unlock it.
- **No MFA-authenticated credentials.** `GetSessionToken` and `AssumeRole` accept `SerialNumber`
  and `TokenCode` on AWS and return credentials that carry the MFA context keys. Floci's
  [STS](sts.md) implementations ignore both parameters, so there is no way to obtain a session that
  would satisfy an MFA condition even once the keys are populated.

Both are out of scope here: this covers the device lifecycle only, and wiring MFA into
authorization means touching the request context and STS session shape, which is separate work.

### Account

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| GetAccountSummary | Returns entity counts (users, groups, roles, customer-managed policies, instance profiles, MFA devices) and IAM quota values. `Providers` counts OIDC providers only; SAML providers are not included. Resources Floci does not track (the account password) are reported as zero rather than omitted. |
| GetAccountAuthorizationDetails | Returns every user, group and role in the account, and the policies relevant to them: every local (customer-managed) policy, and every AWS-managed policy actually attached to or used as a permissions boundary by something in the account. |
| GenerateCredentialReport | Generates (or, within 4 hours of the last one, reuses) the account's credential report. |
| GetCredentialReport | Returns the most recently generated credential report as Base64-encoded CSV. |

`Filter`, `MaxItems` and `Marker` are not honored: the response always includes everything, with
`IsTruncated` always `false`. `AttachmentCount` and `PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount` are computed by
scanning the account's own users, groups and roles rather than read off a stored counter, so they
are correctly scoped to the calling account even for an AWS-managed policy (see the note on
`IamService.getAccountAuthorizationDetails` for why that distinction matters). Policy documents are
returned as plain JSON, not URL-encoded as AWS documents them; this matches every other IAM action
that returns a policy document (`GetPolicyVersion`, `GetRolePolicy`, and so on), none of which
URL-encode either.

The credential report holds the 23 columns AWS documents, always led by a `<root_account>` row.
Floci does not model root account credentials at all (`GetAccountSummary`'s
`AccountPasswordPresent`/`AccountAccessKeysPresent` are always zero for the same reason), so that
row is placeholder values throughout, including its `mfa_active`, which reports on root rather
than on any IAM user's device. X.509 signing certificates are not modeled, so every `cert_*` column
is always `FALSE`/`N/A`; access key last-used tracking (date, region, service) is not modeled, so
those three columns are always `N/A` too. `mfa_active` on a user row is real, and is `TRUE` once
the user has a device enabled. `password_last_used` is likewise not tracked, so it is always `no_information`.
`password_last_changed` reflects an `UpdateLoginProfile` password change, not just
`CreateLoginProfile`. `additional_credentials_info` is Floci's own wording, since AWS does not
document the exact text; in practice it is unreachable, since `CreateAccessKey` already enforces
the real 2-key-per-user quota. Generating a report is effectively instant, so `GenerateCredentialReport` never actually
returns `INPROGRESS`, and a `GetCredentialReport` call right after it always finds the report
ready. `GenerateCredentialReport`'s `State`/`Description` for the no-report-exists case match AWS's
own documented example response (`STARTED` / "No report exists. Starting a new report generation
task"); the wording for the report-expired case is Floci's own, since AWS does not document it.

### Organizations Root Access

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ListOrganizationsFeatures | Lists the centralized root access features that are currently enabled. |
| EnableOrganizationsRootCredentialsManagement | Enables the `RootCredentialsManagement` feature. |
| DisableOrganizationsRootCredentialsManagement | Disables the `RootCredentialsManagement` feature. |
| EnableOrganizationsRootSessions | Enables the `RootSessions` feature. |
| DisableOrganizationsRootSessions | Disables the `RootSessions` feature. |

Only the set of enabled features is stored, and enabling a feature twice is idempotent. Floci does not
model root credentials or root sessions themselves, so the flags change what `ListOrganizationsFeatures`
returns and nothing else.

### Server Certificates

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| UploadServerCertificate | Stores a PEM certificate, its private key and an optional chain under a name unique to the account. |
| GetServerCertificate | Returns a stored certificate and its chain, never the private key. |
| UpdateServerCertificate | Renames a certificate and/or changes its path; the ARN moves with it. |
| DeleteServerCertificate | Deletes a stored certificate. |
| ListServerCertificates | Lists certificate metadata, filtered by `PathPrefix`. |
| TagServerCertificate | Adds tags to a server certificate. |
| UntagServerCertificate | Removes tags from a server certificate. |
| ListServerCertificateTags | Lists tags stored for a server certificate. |

The uploaded material is really parsed, because two of this operation's modeled errors cannot be
answered otherwise. `CertificateBody` (and `CertificateChain`, when given) must be readable PEM or
the upload is `MalformedCertificate`, and the private key must actually match the certificate's
public key or it is `KeyPairMismatch`. The match is a sign-then-verify check, so it holds for RSA
and EC alike. `Expiration` is read from the certificate's own `notAfter` rather than stored
separately, so it cannot drift from the certificate it describes.

The private key is stored and never returned. AWS marks `privateKeyType` sensitive and models it
only on the upload, so neither `GetServerCertificate` nor `ListServerCertificates` echoes it back.
`ListServerCertificates` returns metadata only, as AWS documents: it "does not return the
certificate body, certificate chain, or private key".

`ServerCertificateId` uses AWS's `ASCA` prefix for certificates. `GetAccountSummary`'s
`ServerCertificates` count is backed by this store rather than reporting zero.

`DeleteServerCertificate` returns `DeleteConflict` while the certificate is in use, as AWS does.
Services that reference a certificate (ELB Classic listeners, ELBv2 listeners, CloudFront
distributions) report it through `ServerCertificateReferenceProvider`, which IAM consults without
depending on them. In the other direction, ELB Classic rejects a listener whose `SSLCertificateId`
names no certificate with `CertificateNotFound`, and CloudFront rejects an unknown
`ViewerCertificate.IAMCertificateId` with `InvalidViewerCertificate`.

### SSH Public Keys

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| UploadSSHPublicKey | Stores an SSH public key against an IAM user and returns its generated `SSHPublicKeyId`. |
| GetSSHPublicKey | Returns a key in the encoding `Encoding` asks for, `SSH` or `PEM`. |
| ListSSHPublicKeys | Lists a user's keys as metadata, with `Marker` and `MaxItems` paging. |
| UpdateSSHPublicKey | Sets a key's status to `Active`, `Inactive` or `Expired`. |
| DeleteSSHPublicKey | Deletes one of a user's SSH public keys. |

AWS accepts the body "encoded in ssh-rsa format or PEM format", so both are read, and the body is
kept exactly as it arrived: a caller that uploaded PEM gets that PEM back rather than a re-encoding
of it. `GetSSHPublicKey` converts, because `Encoding` is required and decides the form of the
response, so a key uploaded as `ssh-rsa` comes back as PEM when PEM is asked for.

`Fingerprint` is the MD5 of the OpenSSH blob, which is what AWS reports here. It is deliberately not
the digest EC2 reports for the same key, which is taken over the DER: both are sixteen bytes of
colon-delimited hex, so the wrong one would look entirely plausible. The value is checked against
the worked example in the IAM API Reference rather than assumed.

Five keys per user, which the IAM service quotas give as "SSH Public keys per user" and mark as not
adjustable. A sixth upload is `LimitExceeded`, counted inside the same lock as the write so
concurrent uploads cannot both see room for the last slot. The minimum bit-length is 2048, as the
model documents.

The two rejection errors are kept apart the way the model separates them. A body in neither accepted
encoding is `UnrecognizedPublicKeyEncoding`; a body in a recognised encoding that will not parse, or
that carries a key type other than `ssh-rsa`, is `InvalidPublicKey`. An OpenSSH line is recognised by
its key-type token rather than by whether part of it happens to base64-decode, since short words
often do.

`DuplicateSSHPublicKey` is per user, not account-wide: AWS describes it as a key "already associated
with the specified IAM user", so two users may hold the same key. The comparison is on the
fingerprint, so the same key uploaded in the other encoding still counts as a duplicate.

`ListSSHPublicKeys` returns metadata only. AWS documents `SSHPublicKeyMetadata` as describing a key
"without the key's body or fingerprint", so neither appears in the list even though both are stored.

An SSH public key blocks `DeleteUser` until it is removed, which is one of the items AWS lists as a
prerequisite for deleting a user programmatically, and it follows the user across an `UpdateUser`
rename: left behind, a key would be stranded on a name that no longer exists, invisible to its owner
because listing goes through the user.

`UserName` is required on every one of these operations except `ListSSHPublicKeys`, where the model
marks it optional and it resolves from the access key that signed the request. That is the opposite
of the signing-certificate operations, where it is optional throughout.

Under [enforcement](#iam-enforcement-mode) these actions are evaluated against `*` rather than the
owning user's ARN, along with every other IAM action except the server-certificate operations, which
is the general gap tracked in [#4979](https://github.com/floci-io/floci/issues/4979).

### Signing Certificates

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| UploadSigningCertificate | Stores an X.509 signing certificate against an IAM user and returns its generated `CertificateId`. |
| ListSigningCertificates | Lists a user's signing certificates, with `Marker` and `MaxItems` paging. |
| UpdateSigningCertificate | Sets a certificate's status to `Active`, `Inactive` or `Expired`. |
| DeleteSigningCertificate | Deletes one of a user's signing certificates. |

A signing certificate is not a server certificate: it belongs to a user rather than the account, it
carries no private key, no name and no path, and the generated `CertificateId` is the only handle
to it. The body is parsed on upload, because `MalformedCertificate` cannot be answered without
reading the material, and the status starts as `Active`.

`UserName` is optional on all four operations. Left out, it resolves to the user owning the access
key that signed the request, which is what the model documents.

Two certificates per user, which the User Guide states directly: "Users can have up to two X.509
signing certificates, to make certificate rotation easier". A third upload is `LimitExceeded`. The
count is taken inside the same lock as the write, so concurrent uploads cannot both see room for
the last slot.

`DuplicateCertificate` is account-wide rather than per user: AWS describes it as "the same
certificate is associated with an IAM user in the account", so a second user cannot upload material
the first already holds. The comparison is made on the encoded certificate rather than the PEM
text, so the same certificate re-wrapped or re-indented still counts as the same one.

`UpdateSigningCertificate` accepts `Expired` as well as `Active` and `Inactive`. The parameter's
prose explains only the first two, but the API Reference gives all three as valid values.

A signing certificate blocks `DeleteUser` until it is removed, which is one of the items AWS lists
as a prerequisite for deleting a user programmatically. It also follows the user across an
`UpdateUser` rename: left behind, a certificate would be stranded on a name that no longer exists,
invisible to its owner because listing goes through the user.

The credential report's `cert_1_active` and `cert_2_active` columns are backed by this store
instead of always reporting `FALSE`. The matching `cert_*_last_rotated` columns report the upload
date, and `N/A` when the certificate is not `Active`, which is how the User Guide defines them.
`GetAccountSummary`'s `AccountSigningCertificatesPresent` is unaffected: it reports the account root
user's certificates, and Floci does not model root credentials.

Under [enforcement](#iam-enforcement-mode) these actions are evaluated against `*` rather than the
owning user's ARN, along with every other IAM action except the server-certificate operations. That
is the general gap tracked in [#4979](https://github.com/floci-io/floci/issues/4979), not something
specific to signing certificates.

### Service-Specific Credentials

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CreateServiceSpecificCredential | Generates a credential for one service against an IAM user and returns its generated `ServiceSpecificCredentialId`. |
| ListServiceSpecificCredentials | Lists a user's credentials, or every user's with `AllUsers`, optionally filtered by `ServiceName`. |
| UpdateServiceSpecificCredential | Sets a credential's status to `Active`, `Inactive` or `Expired`. |
| ResetServiceSpecificCredential | Replaces the secret half of a credential and returns the new one. |
| DeleteServiceSpecificCredential | Deletes one of a user's service-specific credentials. |

These are what AWS calls Git credentials when they are used with CodeCommit. A service that does not
support them is `NotSupportedService`. That is the wire code, which reverses the words of its own
shape name, `ServiceNotSupportedException`.

**A credential has one of two shapes, decided by the service:**

| Service | Shape |
|---------|-------|
| `codecommit.amazonaws.com` | `ServiceUserName` + `ServicePassword` |
| `cassandra.amazonaws.com` | `ServiceUserName` + `ServicePassword` |
| `bedrock.amazonaws.com` | long-term API key: `ServiceCredentialAlias` + `ServiceCredentialSecret` |
| `aws-external-anthropic.amazonaws.com` | long-term API key |
| `cloudwatch.amazonaws.com` | long-term API key |
| `logs.amazonaws.com` | long-term API key |

That list is the subset AWS's documentation actually names. The User Guide's own enumeration falls
on a page boundary and is absent from the published PDF, so these come from two other passages: the
`iam:ServiceName` condition-key section, which gives CodeCommit, Keyspaces and Bedrock "with their
exact value formatting", and the worked `create-service-specific-credential` CLI block, which
creates the four long-term API key services. A service AWS supports that neither passage names would
be refused here. A legacy per-partition form of a supported principal is accepted and folded to the
universal one, so `bedrock.amazonaws.com.cn` works and comes back as `bedrock.amazonaws.com`; a bare
`codecommit` does not, because AWS documents these with their exact formatting.

Only the long-term API key services accept `CredentialAgeDays`, which the model restricts to
"services that support long-term API keys" and which sets the `ExpirationDate`. It is 1 to 36600
days. Without it the credential does not expire and no expiry is reported. A present but
unparseable value is a validation error rather than a silent absence, since answering it with a
credential that never expires is the opposite of what was asked for.

**A key past its `ExpirationDate` reports `Expired`.** The status is derived when it is read rather
than written back, so the value a caller set is left alone and an `UpdateServiceSpecificCredential`
to `Active` cannot make an expired key report as usable. Expiry outranks `Inactive` as well, since a
key past its expiry is finished either way and `Expired` says more.

This one is a judgement call rather than a sourced behaviour, and worth knowing about. AWS does not
document the transition: `Expired` is in the `statusType` enum, but that enum is shared with access
keys, SSH public keys and signing certificates, most of which have no expiry at all, and the API
Reference's prose describes only `Active` and `Inactive`. Of the two available guesses, reporting an
expired key as `Active` is the worse one, because it tells a caller the key works while the same
response carries the date saying it does not. Nothing authenticates with these credentials in Floci
either way, so the status is the only place the expiry can show.

The secret half, whichever shape it takes, is disclosed by `CreateServiceSpecificCredential` and
`ResetServiceSpecificCredential` and never again: `ListServiceSpecificCredentials` returns
`ServiceSpecificCredentialMetadata`, which the model defines without either secret. A reset keeps
the id, the service and the service user name or alias: only what authenticates with the credential
changes. Note that the User Guide calls the long-term key's secret `ServiceApiKeyValue` in prose;
that is not a wire name, and both the API Reference and the model call it
`ServiceCredentialSecret`.

`ServiceUserName` is derived the way AWS derives it, as the IAM user name, the account, and a `+n`
between them for the second credential: `anika-at-123456789012` and then
`anika+1-at-123456789012`, which are the API Reference's own examples. `ServiceCredentialAlias`
plays the same role for a long-term key, and AWS documents it only as including "the IAM user name
and a suffix containing version and creation information" without publishing a format, so the one
here is Floci's: `anika+v1-20261004`.

In both cases the version is the lowest one not currently in use rather than a count of what
exists, because a count repeats a name as soon as a credential is deleted out of order. Holding
only `anika+1`, a count of one would mint `anika+1` again and two live credentials would share the
name the caller authenticates with. It is taken inside the same lock as the write, so two
concurrent creates cannot both claim the same version.

**The quota is two per service, not two per user**: the User Guide gives "a maximum of two sets of
service-specific credentials for each supported service per IAM user", so a user may hold two for
each of the six while a third for any one of them is `LimitExceeded`. Unlike the SSH public key
limit, this one has no row in the IAM service quotas table, matching the User Guide's framing of it
as a fixed design limit rather than an adjustable quota.

`AllUsers` cannot be given together with `UserName`, which the model says in as many words, so
naming both is a validation error rather than one quietly winning.

`UserName` is required on `CreateServiceSpecificCredential` and optional on the other four, where it
resolves from the access key that signed the request. That is a third pattern again: the
signing-certificate operations take it optionally throughout, and the SSH key operations require it
everywhere but the list.

A service-specific credential blocks `DeleteUser` until it is removed, the last of the items AWS
lists as a prerequisite for deleting a user programmatically, and it follows the user across an
`UpdateUser` rename: left behind, a credential would be stranded on a name that no longer exists,
invisible to its owner because listing goes through the user. The `ServiceUserName` is left as it
was minted rather than re-derived from the new name, because it is what the caller authenticates
with and rewriting it would break a working credential; AWS does not document which way it goes, so
this is a choice rather than a sourced behaviour.

Under [enforcement](#iam-enforcement-mode) these actions are evaluated against `*` rather than the
owning user's ARN, as the general gap in
[#4979](https://github.com/floci-io/floci/issues/4979) describes.

## AWS Managed Policies

Floci seeds a catalog of commonly-used AWS managed policies at startup. These are attachable immediately without any setup:

**General access**
`AdministratorAccess` · `PowerUserAccess` · `ReadOnlyAccess` · `IAMFullAccess` · `AmazonS3FullAccess` · `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` · `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` · `AmazonEC2FullAccess` · `AmazonSQSFullAccess` · `AmazonSNSFullAccess` · `AmazonVPCFullAccess` · `CloudWatchFullAccess` · `AWSLambdaFullAccess`

**Lambda execution roles** (`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/...`)
`AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` · `AWSLambdaBasicDurableExecutionRolePolicy` · `AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole` · `AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole` · `AWSLambdaMSKExecutionRole` · `AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole` · `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`

**ECS / EKS execution roles**
`AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` · `AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy`

**EKS cluster & node groups**
`AmazonEKSClusterPolicy` · `AmazonEKSServicePolicy` · `AmazonEKSVPCResourceController` · `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy` · `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`

**Other execution roles**
`AmazonS3ObjectLambdaExecutionRolePolicy` · `CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy` · `CloudWatchLambdaApplicationSignalsExecutionRolePolicy` · `AWSConfigRulesExecutionRole` · `AWSMSKReplicatorExecutionRole` · `AWS-SSM-DiagnosisAutomation-ExecutionRolePolicy` · `AWS-SSM-RemediationAutomation-ExecutionRolePolicy` · `AmazonSageMakerGeospatialExecutionRole` · `AmazonSageMakerCanvasEMRServerlessExecutionRolePolicy` · `SageMakerStudioBedrockFunctionExecutionRolePolicy` · `SageMakerStudioDomainExecutionRolePolicy` · `SageMakerStudioQueryExecutionRolePolicy` · `AmazonDataZoneDomainExecutionRolePolicy` · `AmazonBedrockAgentCoreMemoryBedrockModelInferenceExecutionRolePolicy` · `AWSPartnerCentralSellingResourceSnapshotJobExecutionRolePolicy`

Every catalog entry carries the real policy document of its current default version, generated from the public [iam-dataset](https://github.com/iann0036/iam-dataset), so `GetPolicyVersion` returns the same statements a real account would and enforcement mode evaluates them faithfully.

### Version numbers

AWS revises its managed policies in place, so their default version is rarely `v1`: `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` is on `v3`, `ReadOnlyAccess` far beyond that, while `AdministratorAccess` has never been revised. Floci reports the version id AWS publishes for each policy, the date the policy was first created as `CreateDate`, and the date of its current default version as `UpdateDate`:

```bash
aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 iam get-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
# -> DefaultVersionId: "v3", CreateDate: 2015-02-06T18:40:00Z, UpdateDate: 2023-08-10T21:31:39Z

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 iam list-policy-versions \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
# -> a single entry, v3, IsDefaultVersion: true
```

Only the default version's document is bundled. Requesting a superseded version (`v1` or `v2` of `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`) returns `NoSuchEntity`, the same answer AWS gives once it has pruned a managed policy's history, and `ListPolicyVersions` lists only the default. AWS managed policies remain read-only: `CreatePolicyVersion`, `SetDefaultPolicyVersion` and `DeletePolicyVersion` are rejected with `AccessDenied`.

## Optional Local Deployer Principal

Floci can seed a local IAM user for development workflows that expect a concrete caller identity before provisioning starts. This is disabled by default.

Enable it with:

```bash
FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_SEED_DEPLOYER_PRINCIPAL=true
```

When enabled, Floci creates the `floci-deployer` user if it does not already exist, attaches `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess`, and creates static `floci` / `floci` access-key credentials if that access key does not already exist. Existing users and access keys are preserved.

Requests signed with the seeded access key return the deployer user ARN from `sts:GetCallerIdentity`.

## IAM Enforcement Mode

By default Floci accepts any credentials without enforcing IAM policies — all requests are allowed through regardless of what policies are attached to the calling identity. This preserves backward compatibility and keeps the default setup frictionless.

Setting `enforcement-enabled: true` activates the policy evaluator as a JAX-RS request filter. Every inbound request is then evaluated against the identity-based policies of the calling IAM user or assumed role before it reaches the service handler. This includes IAM's own management actions (`iam:CreateUser`, `iam:CreateGroup`, `iam:AttachUserPolicy`, `iam:DeleteUser`, ...): a user whose policies only grant, say, `s3:*` receives `AccessDenied` when calling them.

The startup banner reports the effective state (`IAM: policy enforcement enabled` / `disabled`). If requests you expect to be denied keep succeeding, check that line first: the flag is only read under the name below, and any other spelling (for example `FLOCI_IAM_STRICT_VALIDATION`, which does not exist) is silently ignored, leaving the permissive default in place.

### Enable enforcement

**Environment variable:**
```bash
FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true
```

Docker Compose:
```yaml
environment:
  FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Evaluation rules

Policy evaluation follows the standard AWS precedence:

1. If [SCP enforcement](#service-control-policies-scps) is active, the action must be allowed at **every** organization level (root, OUs on the path, account) and explicitly denied at none — otherwise the request is denied before identity policies are consulted
2. An explicit **Deny** in any identity, session, or boundary policy denies the request
3. An explicit **Allow** in an identity policy creates the base grant
4. If a session policy is present, it must also explicitly allow the request
5. If a permission boundary is present, it must also explicitly allow the request
6. No matching effective allow results in an implicit deny

IAM authorization denials return HTTP 400 `AccessDeniedException` for AWS JSON 1.0/1.1
requests. REST-JSON requests return HTTP 403 `AccessDeniedException`; AWS Query and S3
requests retain HTTP 403 XML `AccessDenied` responses. The routed protocol determines
the status, not just the request's content type.

A REST request is authorized as the operation of the route it reached. An `X-Amz-Target` header or
a Query `Action` field on it does not change the action it is checked as, and its path is matched
still percent-encoded, as the router matches it, so an encoded `/` inside a parameter cannot make
the route's rule miss.

### Resource-based policies

When `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` is active, Floci also queries registered `ResourcePolicyProvider` SPI implementations (such as S3 bucket policies) during request authorization:

- Resource policy statements are matched against the caller (`Principal` and `NotPrincipal` clauses), each principal type naming only its own kind of caller, as on AWS: `"*"` matches anyone; `{"AWS": "*"}` matches IAM identities and AWS services; any other `AWS` entry (a user, role, account id or account root) matches IAM identities only, and a role session matches a `Principal` naming its role through the role's own ARN, path included; `{"Service": "<name>"}` matches that service exactly. `{"CanonicalUser": "<id>"}`, which S3 bucket policies accept, names an account by its S3 canonical user ID and matches that account's IAM identities, as an account principal does; Floci's canonical ID for an account is the account id, as its S3 ACLs report it. `{"Service": "*"}`, which AWS does not accept, matches nothing, and `Federated` entries never match an IAM caller.
- An explicit **Deny** in a resource policy overrides any allows.
- In cross-account scenarios or resource-controlled access, an explicit **Allow** in a resource policy grants access to the principal.
- For detailed S3 bucket policy behavior and configuration, see [S3 Bucket Policy Enforcement](s3.md#bucket-policy-enforcement).

### Service control policies (SCPs)

When the caller's account belongs to an [Organizations](organizations.md) organization,
SCPs attached to the root, the OUs on the account's path, and the account itself can
participate in evaluation. Two flags must both be on:

```yaml
floci:
  services:
    iam:
      enforcement-enabled: true
    organizations:
      scp-enforcement-enabled: true
```

(env: `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` and
`FLOCI_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_SCP_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED`)

SCP semantics match AWS: SCPs never grant permissions — they cap what identity policies
may allow; the organization's **management account is exempt**; and an account outside
any organization is unaffected. The `test` credential is never SCP-denied.

**The account-root principal is subject to SCPs.** floci's account root is a bare
12-digit account-id access key (the LocalStack multi-account convention). It carries no
registered IAM identity, so it normally takes the unknown-key bypass. But when the access
key equals its own account ID **and** that account has an effective SCP ceiling
(`effectiveScpLevels != null` — i.e. it is a non-management member under a root with the
SCP policy type enabled and at least one attached SCP), floci synthesizes an
allow-everything root identity and evaluates the request against the SCP chain. In that
case **SCPs apply and nothing else does** — no identity policies, permission boundary, or
session policy attaches to the bare account key. If the account has no effective SCP
ceiling (the management account, an account outside any organization, or the SCP type
disabled), the bare key still bypasses enforcement entirely. An `AKIA…` key that exists
nowhere is rejected rather than bypassed.

### Bypass rules

These identities always bypass enforcement (backward-compatible defaults):

| Identity | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Access key `test` (the default dev credential) | Always allowed — no policy lookup |
| Access key that exists nowhere | **Rejected** with `403`: `InvalidAccessKeyId` for S3, `InvalidClientTokenId` for Query services, `UnrecognizedClientException` for JSON services |
| Credential the filter cannot map to policies, such as a session carrying no role ARN | Allowed: it is a real credential, so rejecting it would refuse an authenticated caller |
| No `Authorization` header | Allowed — unauthenticated path (e.g. health checks) |
| Unresolvable IAM action for the request | Allowed — unknown mappings are permissive |

**IAM's own resources are mostly not named.** When enforcement evaluates a request, the target
resource comes from `ResourceArnBuilder`, which builds an ARN for S3, Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB,
Kinesis, Secrets Manager, SSM, KMS, and, within IAM, only the server-certificate operations. Every
other IAM action is evaluated against `*`, so a statement naming a specific user, role, policy,
instance profile, MFA device or identity provider does not constrain it: a `Deny` on
`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/bob` does not stop `DeleteUser` from running, and an `Allow`
scoped to one role does not limit `DeleteRole` to it. Action-level matching works normally, so
denying `iam:DeleteUser` outright does take effect; it is only the resource half that is missing.

This is the behaviour IAM has always had here rather than a recent change, and it errs toward
permissive, which is the direction worth knowing about. Closing it means mapping the resource of
every dispatched IAM action, which is tracked in
[#4979](https://github.com/floci-io/floci/issues/4979) rather than bundled into the
server-certificate work that mapped the first few.

**A certificate rename names two resources.** `UpdateServerCertificate` is evaluated against both
the certificate's current ARN and the ARN that `NewServerCertificateName` or `NewPath` would
produce, because AWS requires the principal to hold permission on the old name and the new one: a
principal allowed to update `ProductionCert` but not `ProdCert` cannot rename the first into the
second. A request naming several resources is authorized once per resource, so a `Deny` on either
name refuses the rename, and the certificate keeps its original name and path. An update that
changes neither the name nor the path names a single resource. The destination ARN is built beside
the stored one, keeping the certificate's own partition and account, since a rename moves a
certificate within an account rather than between partitions.

**Exception:** a bare 12-digit account-id key that equals its own account and sits under
an effective SCP ceiling is **not** treated as an unknown key — it is evaluated against
the SCP chain as the account root (see [Service control policies](#service-control-policies-scps)
above). Identity-policy enforcement of a member account still requires an assumable,
account-routable identity such as the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` session; the bare
account key carries no identity policies of its own.

### Supported policy features

- **Identity-based policies**: inline user/group/role policies and managed attached policies.
- **Session policies**: inline policies passed during `sts:AssumeRole`.
- **Permission boundaries**: managed policies used to cap maximum permissions.
- **Action/Resource patterns**: literal matches, wildcards (`*`, `?`), and `NotAction`/`NotResource` blocks.
  Action names match without regard to case, resource ARNs match case-sensitively, as on AWS.
- **Conditions**: support for `Condition` blocks with multiple operators.
- **Effects**: `Allow` and `Deny`.

#### Supported Condition Operators:
- `StringEquals`, `StringNotEquals`, `StringEqualsIgnoreCase`, `StringNotEqualsIgnoreCase`
- `StringLike`, `StringNotLike`: case-sensitive glob matching with `*` and `?`.
- `ArnEquals`, `ArnLike`, `ArnNotEquals`, `ArnNotLike`: case-sensitive glob matching
  of each of the six ARN components independently. Wildcards cannot cross the first five
  colon separators; colons within the resource component are retained. `ArnEquals` and
  `ArnLike` behave identically, as do their negated forms. Service-principal trust policies
  use the same component-by-component ARN matching for `aws:SourceArn`.
- `NumericEquals`, `NumericNotEquals`, `NumericLessThan`, `NumericGreaterThan` (and Equals variants)
- `DateEquals`, `DateNotEquals`, `DateLessThan`, `DateGreaterThan` (and Equals variants)
- `Bool`, `IpAddress`, `NotIpAddress`, `Null`
- Supports `...IfExists` variants for all operators.
- Set operators `ForAllValues:` and `ForAnyValue:` over multi-valued condition keys, in AWS's
  own spelling (the prefix match is case-sensitive). They compose with `IfExists`
  (`ForAnyValue:StringEqualsIfExists`). `ForAllValues:` over an empty set matches vacuously
  and `ForAnyValue:` over an empty set does not match, so pair `ForAllValues:` with
  `"Null":{"<key>":"false"}` as you would on AWS: `Null` treats a present-but-empty set as
  absent, so the guard fires either way.
- When a condition lists several values, a positive operator matches if the request value
  equals **any** of them; a negated operator (`StringNotEquals`, `ArnNotLike`, `NotIpAddress`,
  …) matches only if the request value differs from **all** of them. This is what makes
  `ForAllValues:StringNotEquals` on `dynamodb:Attributes` a usable deny-list.

#### Condition keys floci populates

A `Condition` operator can only match a key floci actually places in the request context.
floci populates:

- `s3:prefix`, `s3:delimiter`, `s3:max-keys`: from the S3 request parameters.
- `aws:RequestTag/<key>`: the tags named in the request itself, before they are applied, for
  `ec2:RunInstances` (`TagSpecification.N`), `ec2:CreateTags` (`Tag.N`) and
  `s3:PutBucketTagging` (the `<Tagging>` body).
- `aws:ResourceTag/<key>`: the target resource's current tags, for `ec2:CreateTags`,
  `ec2:DeleteTags`, `ec2:TerminateInstances` and `ec2:DescribeInstances` (the first
  `ResourceId.N` or `InstanceId.N`), and for `s3:GetBucketTagging`, `s3:DeleteBucketTagging`
  and `s3:DeleteBucket` (the bucket). A request naming several EC2 resources is evaluated
  once per resource and denied when any of them fails the condition, as on AWS.
- `s3:ExistingObjectTag/<key>`: the tags already on the target object version, for
  `s3:GetObject`, `s3:GetObjectTagging`, `s3:GetObjectAcl`, `s3:PutObjectAcl`,
  `s3:DeleteObjectTagging` and `s3:PutObjectTagging`. A `versionId` in the request selects the
  version whose tags are read. **`s3:DeleteObject` and `s3:PutObject` do not receive this key**, as measured on AWS.
  An allow conditioned on it denies the delete of a correctly tagged object, and a create cannot
  be gated on tags an object does not have yet.
- `s3:RequestObjectTag/<key>`: a tag the request asks to attach. `s3:PutObject` reads these
  from the `x-amz-tagging` header and `s3:PutObjectTagging` from the `<Tagging>` body. Any pair
  that does not decode is dropped, so a policy conditioned on the key denies such a request. Where
  enforcement lets it through, the handler still answers a malformed header with
  `400 InvalidTag`. `s3:RequestObjectTagKeys` is **not** populated, so a condition on it never
  matches.
- A `PutObject` carrying `If-Match` is authorized as `s3:GetObject` as well, and that second
  check is made without the object's tags in the context, as measured on AWS. `If-None-Match`
  needs no such permission.
- `aws:PrincipalArn`: the caller's ARN, resolved from the signing access key. It is the
  IAM-user ARN for a user access key, and `arn:aws:iam::<account>:root` for the bare account-id
  key (floci's account-root principal), matching the ARN shape AWS itself reports for the account
  root. For an STS role session it is the ARN of the role that was assumed, path included, not the
  `assumed-role` session ARN, as AWS reports it ("For IAM roles, the request context returns the
  ARN of the role"); a condition naming the session ARN does not match. It is **absent** only for
  unknown keys, where nothing about the caller can be resolved.
- `dynamodb:LeadingKeys`, `dynamodb:Attributes`, `dynamodb:Select`: from the DynamoDB request
  body, for `GetItem`, `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`, `Query`, `BatchGetItem` and
  `BatchWriteItem` (`dynamodb:Select` for `Query` and `Scan`). `LeadingKeys` holds the
  partition-key values the request names: from `Key`, `Item`, the `KeyConditionExpression`
  equality, the legacy `KeyConditions` `EQ` entry, or each `RequestItems` entry. `Attributes`
  holds the attribute names the request *names* (item and key fields, `AttributesToGet`,
  projection / update / filter / condition / key-condition expressions, and
  `ExpressionAttributeNames`); a request with no projection returns every attribute while
  reporting only the names it mentions, exactly as on AWS, which is why AWS pairs `Attributes`
  with `dynamodb:Select`. Each key is **omitted** when it cannot be determined (unknown table,
  a `Key` that omits the partition attribute, an unparseable `KeyConditionExpression`, a
  multi-table batch), so a policy scoping access through it denies the request rather than
  allowing an unproven one.

  **Consequence:** with enforcement on and access scoped purely through `dynamodb:LeadingKeys`,
  a malformed request (such as a `GetItem` whose `Key` omits the partition attribute) is answered with
  `AccessDeniedException` instead of the `ValidationException` DynamoDB would return. Failing
  closed is the correct direction for a security boundary.

**Any other condition key is absent from the request context.** A plain (non-`IfExists`)
operator on an absent key makes the whole statement *not apply*: it neither matches nor
blocks. A `DenyRootUser`-style guardrail keyed on `aws:PrincipalArn` therefore fires against
the account root the same way it does on real AWS, consistent with the account root already
being bounded by SCPs (below): both forms of root enforcement now agree. A negated operator
(`StringNotEquals`, `ArnNotLike`, `NotIpAddress` and the rest) is the exception, as on AWS: an
absent key cannot equal what the policy names, so the condition holds, and a `Deny` written
that way applies when the key is missing.

**Not yet supported**: `NotPrincipal`, resource-based policies (S3 bucket policy, Lambda resource
policy), and `dynamodb:LeadingKeys` for `Scan`, `TransactWriteItems` / `TransactGetItems` and the
PartiQL operations.

### Assumed roles

When a caller uses `sts:AssumeRole` the returned session credentials are registered internally. Subsequent requests signed with those session credentials are evaluated against:
1. The **role's** attached and inline policies.
2. The **session policy** (if provided during `AssumeRole`), acting as an intersection filter.

### Example — minimal enforcement setup

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

# Create a user and get credentials
aws iam create-user --user-name alice
KEY=$(aws iam create-access-key --user-name alice --query 'AccessKey.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey]' --output text)
AKID=$(echo $KEY | awk '{print $1}')
SECRET=$(echo $KEY | awk '{print $2}')

# Create and attach a policy that allows S3 list
POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name allow-s3-list \
  --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Action":"s3:ListAllMyBuckets","Resource":"*"}]}' \
  --query 'Policy.Arn' --output text)

aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name alice --policy-arn $POLICY_ARN

# alice can now list buckets
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AKID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$SECRET \
  aws s3 ls
```

## Service Control Policies (SCPs)

When `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true` and
`FLOCI_SERVICES_ORGANIZATIONS_SCP_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=true`, service control policies attached to
the caller account's organization participate in policy evaluation.

The SCP chain is resolved root → OUs on the path → account, and every level must allow the action
for the request to proceed. SCPs never grant permissions on their own — they are a ceiling applied
before identity policies are consulted, exactly as on AWS. Organizations is resolved lazily, so IAM
does not gain a hard dependency on it: with the Organizations service absent or the flag off, the
chain is skipped entirely and evaluation falls back to identity policies alone.

A member account's own bare 12-digit access key is floci's account-root principal. It is not a
registered IAM identity, but like the AWS account root it is still bounded by SCPs, so an SCP `Deny`
(for example a `DenyLeaveOrganization` guardrail) blocks it. What that key does *not* carry is any
identity policy — it behaves as allow-everything bounded only by the SCP ceiling. To exercise
**identity-policy** enforcement, use account-routable credentials for the member instead, most
naturally the `ASIA…` session from assuming its `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`.

Note that `aws:PrincipalArn` is populated for the account-root principal too, as
`arn:aws:iam::<account>:root`, so a principal-scoped guardrail keyed on `aws:PrincipalArn`
(for example a `DenyRootUser` statement matching `arn:aws:iam::*:root`) fires against it —
consistent with the account root already being bounded by SCPs above.

A level containing an SCP document that fails to parse denies every action at that level. The
ceiling cannot tell what an unreadable guardrail would have said, and every target also carries
`FullAWSAccess`, so dropping the bad document would leave the level allowing everything.

The ceiling is attached by the request filter, which is the only producer of SCP levels. Two
evaluation paths therefore run without one and are **not** SCP-bounded: `SimulatePrincipalPolicy`,
and the field-level authorization check on the AppSync GraphQL IAM-auth path (the coarse AppSync
request itself still passes through the filter). Both are deliberate non-goals — bounding them
would require IAM to resolve the caller's organization directly, which is the dependency the
lazily-resolved `ScpProvider` exists to avoid.

## Unsigned requests

With enforcement on, a request carrying no `Authorization` header is refused with
`403 MissingAuthenticationToken` when its wire shape names a management operation: a JSON, CBOR or
Query request, identified by `X-Amz-Target`, an rpcv2 path or an `Action` parameter.

Two carve-outs, both deliberate.

**Operations AWS serves without credentials are still allowed.** Signing up or signing in to a
Cognito user pool, and `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, happen before the caller has any AWS
credentials, so AWS marks them as needing none and Floci does the same. The list is taken from the
`authtype: none` trait in AWS's own service models and covers the Cognito user-pool and identity
flows and the two web-identity and SAML `AssumeRole` calls. A Cognito `Admin*` operation is not in that set and does require a signature.

The refusal arrives in the encoding the request used: XML for Query, CBOR for a CBOR request, JSON
otherwise.

**REST requests are not checked.** The same filter sees the API Gateway execute path, Lambda
function URLs, CloudFront serving, the Cognito OIDC endpoints and Floci's own health endpoint, all
of which are unsigned by design, and a REST request does not say which service will serve it. An
unsigned REST call therefore still reaches the service, including an unsigned S3 call.

## Bypass rules

Enforcement is deliberately permissive in a few cases, so that enabling it does not break workloads
the emulator cannot reason about:

| Case | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Unresolvable action | Allowed. An action the registry cannot resolve is not evaluated. |
| No `Authorization` header, RPC protocol | **Rejected** with `403 MissingAuthenticationToken`, unless the operation is one AWS itself serves without credentials. |
| No `Authorization` header, REST protocol | Allowed. This filter also sees the API Gateway execute path, Lambda function URLs, CloudFront serving and the Cognito OIDC endpoints, which are unsigned by design. |
| `sts:GetCallerIdentity` | Always allowed — AWS returns caller identity even when a policy denies it. |
| Access key that exists nowhere | **Rejected** with `403`, in each protocol's own vocabulary: `InvalidAccessKeyId` for S3, `InvalidClientTokenId` for Query services, `UnrecognizedClientException` for JSON services. Allowing it would let any string authorize the request. |
| Known credential with no mappable caller context | Allowed. A stored session carrying no role ARN is a real credential, so it is not treated as unauthenticated. |
| Bare account-id key with no SCP ceiling | Allowed. With no organization or SCP enforcement off, the account root keeps the historical bypass. |
| Bare account-id key **with** an SCP ceiling | Enforced as the account root, bounded by the SCP chain. |

## Service-linked roles

`CreateServiceLinkedRole` puts a role under `/aws-service-role/<principal>/` and marks it as
service-linked. As on AWS, a role carrying that mark is protected: `AttachRolePolicy`,
`DetachRolePolicy`, `PutRolePolicy`, `DeleteRolePolicy`, `PutRolePermissionsBoundary`,
`DeleteRolePermissionsBoundary`, `UpdateRole`, `UpdateAssumeRolePolicy`, `AddRoleToInstanceProfile`,
`RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile` and `DeleteRole` all answer `UnmodifiableEntity` and name the
linked service to go through instead. `TagRole` and `UntagRole` are allowed, as on AWS. Within the
IAM API `DeleteServiceLinkedRole` is the only way to remove such a role — the emulator's own
`/_floci/state/reset` still clears it along with everything else.

Three deviations to be aware of:

- **The role name is derived locally and will not match AWS for most services.** AWS lets each
  linked service choose the name, and it is not computable from the service principal —
  `lex.amazonaws.com` yields `AWSServiceRoleForLexBots` there, where Floci derives
  `AWSServiceRoleForLex`. Read the name back from the create response rather than hardcoding
  it, and do not rely on a name observed locally matching the one AWS mints.
- **Deletion is synchronous.** `DeleteServiceLinkedRole` completes before it returns, so the
  task id it hands back is already finished and `GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus` always
  reports `SUCCEEDED`. The `IN_PROGRESS`, `NOT_STARTED` and `FAILED` states never occur, and no
  failure `Reason` is ever returned — a poll loop works, but its failure branch is never taken.
- **`CreateRole` accepts the `/aws-service-role/` path, which AWS reserves.** AWS rejects that
  prefix on `CreateRole`; Floci allows it and treats the result as an ordinary role, since the
  service-linked mark comes from the action that minted the role rather than from its path. Such
  a role stays fully modifiable, and `DeleteServiceLinkedRole` answers `NoSuchEntity` for it.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the service |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED` | `false` | Enforce IAM policies on all inbound requests |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_SEED_DEPLOYER_PRINCIPAL` | `false` | Seed the optional `floci-deployer` user and `floci` / `floci` access key |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_IAM_ACCOUNT_ALIAS` | _(unset)_ | Seed an account alias at startup; unset means the account has no alias |
